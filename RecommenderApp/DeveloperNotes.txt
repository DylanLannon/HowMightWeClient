Dependencies: Flask and pydot.

Commands (Windows Powershell):
	python -m venv .venv
	source .venv/bin/activate
	pip install -r requirements.txt

Pydot may throw a "dot not found in path" error, so you may have to add the dot.exe or dot.bat file path in yourself

For the questions.json file if something doesn't work as intended or something broke, these might be the potential problems:

- two questions have the exact same string, rendering output to treat them as the same thing and breaking things. Make sure each question is unique
- input type is not "text", "range", "radio" or "checkbox".
- slider_range is not two integer values in an array. Note that slider_num and the number of lists in the array have to match: i.e.
	- slider_range: [[0,100], [0,100]]
	- slider_num: 2
	- subtitle: ["title1", "title2"]
- toc_component can only be: "inputs", "activities", "outputs", "outcomes" or "impacts".
- options should be an array of strings
- If you have answers saved in answers.json and you wanted to change the "question" string, delete answers.json before running the app again to prevent errors.
